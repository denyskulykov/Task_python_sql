After data analysis there were several issues found:
  Duplicate lines. 
    Lines deleted.  
  Lines with all empty cells besides Locode and Phrase. 
    Lines deleted. 
  Values of cells that are more than 1-sigma from the Standard Deviation (4 198 494 144 for AvgMsv as calculated by Excel).
    Lines deleted.
  While preparing the data the incorrect literal value of Msv cell was found.
    Incorrect Msv value replaced by the corresponding AvgMsv value.
  The search phrase "???" probably is incorrect.
    As long as other values in the corresponding row seems to be ok, no changes were applied.

To define regionality: 
  a percent of requests of a phrase by regions was calculated and grouped in a dictionary;
  then a minimum percent value of any one region was obtained;
  then a minimum percent was recursively subtract from all the received percent ratios for all the regions.
